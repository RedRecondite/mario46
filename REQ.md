# Wario64 Deals Requirements

This document outlines the high-level requirements for the Wario64 Deals application. It is divided into backend and frontend functionality, with specific requirements detailed in each section.

## Backend Functionality

This section outlines requirements for the server-side logic, including data fetching from the Bluesky API, processing of deal information (such as extracting URLs, prices, and names), and providing an API endpoint for the frontend to consume the processed deals.

### HLR-001

> The system shall fetch the author feed from the Bluesky API for the configured actor DID.  
>
> **ImplementedBy:** [functions/deals.js](functions/deals.js)
